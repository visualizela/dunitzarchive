**The Robin Dunitz Archive at USC**   
USC is home to the archives of Robin Dunitz, which includes papers, photographs, and other emphemera about art and murals, especially in Los Angeles. Part of this archive has been digitized and made available via USC's Digital Library - [Robin Dunitz Slides of Los Angeles Murals, 1925-2002](http://digitallibrary.usc.edu/cdm/landingpage/collection/p15799coll15). 

The print collection of materials is available at USC's Architecture and Fine Arts Library. This website provides access to a selection of those materials.
