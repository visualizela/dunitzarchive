The work in preparing materials for this website has been done by Clara Valenzeula, Lance Azusada, Beza Denget, and Enrique Martinez III. Grant money from USC's Undergraduate Research Associate Program was used to fund their work during the 2019-2020 academic year. Stacy Williams (Head of AFA Library) and Andy Rutkowski (USC Libraries Visualization Specialist) served as advisers and supervisers. We are incredibly thankful to both Clara and Lance for their creative, thoughtfulness, and energy in helping to get this project off the ground. 

Bios:

Lance Azusada:

Lance Howard Azusada is a recent graduate of the University of Southern California, at which he earned a B.A. in Choral Music. Currently, he is working towards a Single Subject Teaching Credential at California State University Bakersfield. He plans to teach high school level choir after his certification. In particular, Lance is interested in helping rebuild arts education in America, through work in low-income schools and with underrepresented populations.

Clare Valenzuela:

Clara Valenzuela is currently pursuing a PhD in Musicology at Cornell University. Prior to her arrival at Cornell, Clara received a B.A. in Choral Music from the University of Southern California with a minor in Political Thought. Her primary reason for studying musicology is to explore the social and political dimensions of music and art.

Broadly speaking, Clara is interested in the relationship between musical creation and its socio-political context. Recently, she has been drawn to the ways neoliberal capitalism shapes our music-making practice — In particular, she is interested in popular music, punk and “DIY” music, hauntology and cultural memory, latinidad, feminism, and queerness.

Enrique Martinez III:

Enrique Martinez III is a junior at the University of Southern California majoring in Literary Editing & Publishing and Narrative Studies and minoring in Web Technologies & Applications. 

Enrique is interested in librarianship and, after graduation, would like to pursue his MLIS to become a librarian and learn how he can best help people get access to the resources they need. Additionally, he is interested in the health humanities and narrative medicine and would like to explore how these fields intersect with librarianship.
